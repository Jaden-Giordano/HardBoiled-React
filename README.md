# Hard-Boiled React

> A simple ReactJS/Parket boilerplate containing Webpack, Sass, ES6, XO w/ Airbnb style guide, and Ava (w/ Enzyme)!

## Why?

I find myself creating new react projects all the time and usually copy configuration and code from other projects, so instead of doing that I decided to make a little boilerplate and share it to the world.

## How do I use this boilerplate?

Simply create a fork of this repo or download the zipped contents from the [here](https://github.com/Jaden-Giordano/HardBoiled-React/releases) (releases page).
