# Hard-Boiled React

> A simple ReactJS boilderplate containing Webpack, Sass, ES6, XO w/ Airbnb style guide, and Ava (w/ Enzyme)!

## Why?

I find myself creating new react projects all the time and usually copy configuration and code from other projects, so instead of doing that I decided to make a little boilerplate and share it to the world.
